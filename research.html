                <blockquote>
                    Developed low-resource language models for Kurdish and Narragansett using 
                    BERT and HuggingFace in Python, contributing to more inclusive natural language 
                    processing technology for 1,800+ people in underserved linguistic communities 
                    across Rhode Island. Focused on equitable language model training, bias detection, 
                    and linguistic preservation.

                <blockquote>
                    Built a Python tool integrating web scraping and generative AI to streamline 
                    literature reviews on PubMed, reducing manual search time by 25%. Analyzed urban 
                    air quality disparities in disadvantaged Boston neighborhoods using Python, R, and Excel. 
                    Presented findings to 200+ community members at Tufts Medical Center and Boston
