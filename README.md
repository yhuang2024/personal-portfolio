# Yuyuan Huang's Personal Portfolio
Made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Work in progress!

Things I have learned so far through making this website: hover effects, making a reactive slide-through gallery for photos and text, and a general refresher of HTML/CSS.

Next steps: bedazzling my homepage and poetry page and refactoring with React and Typescript (which I am in the process of learning)!
